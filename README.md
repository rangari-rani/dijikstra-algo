# Dijikstra Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest path between a source vertex and all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

- **Grid Representation**: Implemented an interactive grid structure to represent nodes and edges.
- **Pathfinding Visualization:**: Visually demonstrate the step-by-step process of finding the shortest path using animations.
